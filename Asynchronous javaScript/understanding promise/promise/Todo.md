{XMLHttpRequest + Promise}


Create a function named fetch which can accept one parameter an url and returns a promise.
Use XMLHttpRequest to make a network request using the url from parameter
When the data is loaded resolve the promise with the value
If there is any issue loading data reject the promise with an error message
Add-on:

Refactor the image search app you created (in previous exercise) to use the function fetch you crated above.
