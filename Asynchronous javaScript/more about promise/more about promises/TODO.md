Create four promises that resolve after 1, 2, 3 and 4 seconds with a random value. Using Promise.all log the value of each promise that it resolved with.

Create a list of 5 Github usernames in an array and using Promise.all get access to the data of each user from GitHub API. Log the number of followers of each user.

Use Promise.race to see which API resolves faster from the given list of URLs. Log the object you get from the promise that is resolved faster.

Use Promise.allSettled to log the value of each promise from the given list of promises. And also check if Promise.all works with one, two and three or not

const one = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => resolve('Arya'), 1000)
);
const two = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Whoops!')), 2000)
);
const three = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => resolve('John'), 3000)
);



What will be the output of the following code snippet? How much time will it take for the promise to resolve?
Promise.all([
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve('Arya'), 1000);
  }),
  'Sam',
  { name: 'John' },
]).then(console.log);
